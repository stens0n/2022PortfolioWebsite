              <p>The decline in union power over the past 40 years 
                has dramatically increased income inequality and has 
                allowed corporate greed to flourish. Union membership 
                is good for workers. Period. Union workers earn over 
                20% more than their non-union counterparts, enjoy better 
                benefits including healthcare coverage and are much less
                 likely to be the victims of wage theft and safety 
                 violations.

              <p>The climate crisis is the true test of our time. Scientists 
                have determined that if we do not act radically in the next 
                8 years, the effects of climate change will be irreversible 
                and will cause catastrophic events. But I believe in our

                we are causing to the planet and to ourselves. I also believe 
                that we can use this moment as an opportunity to further the 
                cause of economic justice by creating millions of well paid, 
                union jobs around green energy.

              <p>We believe that healthcare is a human right. For too long, 
                we have allowed insurance companies to get between us and our 
                doctors. They profit from denying care to those that need it 
                the most, sending millions into medical bankruptcy and 60,000 
                Americans a year to their deaths. In Massachusetts, almost 
                200,000 people are uninsured, and in low income and minority 
                communities the rate of uninsured is signifcantly higher.  
                Our unnecessarily complex system makes it nearly impossible 
                for undocumented immigrants to find coverage. Life expectancy 
                in Massachusetts seems to be a function of your race and your 
                wealth, and that's not the way it should be.

                an institutional hatred for the poor. In 
                Massachusetts, black and brown 
                people make up 57% of our prison population despite
                being only 18% of the population as a whole. Those in 
                power know exactly how to achieve genuine public safety 
                but they are choosing not to fix our broken system because it is 
                profitable for the police state and the private prison industry. 
                When we prioritize punishment and neglect over rehabilitation, 
                we make society less safe and perpetuate the cycles of poverty 
                that are responsible for crimes of desperation in the first place. 
                Police are given too large a portion of our tax dollars at 
                the expense of social programs as well as too many responsibilities 
                that can be taken over by different social workers that are unarmed.</p>
